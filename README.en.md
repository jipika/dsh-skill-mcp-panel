## Features

> Both panels are **sidebar global panels**, exactly like the built-in Plugins page: clicking Skills/MCP in the left column swaps the center main area to that panel (no modal). Each panel carries a "← Back to session" arrow at its top-left corner that returns you to the session you were reading; picking any session or Plugins from the sidebar also navigates away.

- Skill card list: preview installed skills; expand a card to read the full content
- Status tags: Enabled / Disabled, styled like the built-in plugin list
- Management: hot enable/disable switch, delete, search by name; the page refreshes on entry
- Add skills (0.7.0 unified entry): click “+” and pick files (`.md` / `.zip`), or drag files, archives or skill folders straight onto the page — the structure is auto-detected (bundle / flat files / archive) and invalid content is rejected with a reason
- **Workspace views** (0.3.0): a skill's files live directly where they belong — global skills in `~/.dsh/skills`, workspace skills in that workspace's `.dsh/skills`. A workspace selector below “Skills” (a collapsed dropdown listing Global + each workspace, 11 rows max then scrolls) filters the list to one scope.
- **Batch migration**: the button left of “+” opens a dialog where you pick the source workspace, one or more target workspaces, and the skills yourself, then batch-**copy** or batch-**move** them (nothing pre-selected; items migrate independently — one failure never aborts the rest; move mode allows a single target). When the source scope has groups, you can filter skills by group above the list (0.7.0).
- **Skill groups** (0.5.0): a second bar below the scope bar (All + group names, wrapping onto multiple lines) filters the list to one group. The “Groups” button (left of the migrate button) opens the group editor: create/rename/delete groups, pick a scope, name the group and batch-check members. Groups live only in the plugin's own display config (`~/.dsh/skills/.system/skill-viewer/groups.json`) — skill directories are never touched.

- **Scope-exact operations** (0.6.4): when the same skill name exists in both the global scope and a workspace, delete, enable/disable and content views act on exactly the (name, scope) row you clicked — each row expands and operates independently, other copies are never touched. Missing entries in the given scope fail loudly instead of falling back. The CLI likewise requires `--global` / `--project` / `--workspace` to disambiguate same-name skills in `enable`/`disable`/`delete`.

### Home-sidebar panels and back-to-session (v2.1.0)
- **The management panels moved from the Settings dialog to the home sidebar**, using the
  same slot mechanism as the built-in Plugins page (`sidebar.panellist` list slot + `main`
  keyed slot): clicking Skills/MCP in the left column swaps the center main area, the
  Settings dialog no longer carries those two tabs, and each panel owns its own page shell
  (scroll container and padding). The host must provide those two slots — verified on DSH
  0.1.6-alpha.2.
- **"← Back to session" arrow** at the top-left of both panels: it returns to the session
  you were reading (host `ctx.layout.selectPanel(null)`, which never changes the selected
  session).

### DSH version compatibility (v2.0.5)
- Adapts to the TypertCodec `create()` factory contract introduced in DSH `0.1.6-alpha.2`
  — that change makes plugins still declaring `schema:` throw during registration and
  fail the whole plugin tree (the gateway will not boot). One build now works on **both**
  `0.1.5-rc.2` and earlier (reads `schema`) and `0.1.6-alpha.2` and later (reads `create`),
  with no version probing.
- The scope selector is always a collapsed dropdown (11 rows max, then scrolls); the group
  bar wraps onto multiple lines.
- The skill list no longer depends on whether a session is open; without one the host falls
  back to the global registry.

## Install

1. Install the package (its bundle layer auto-mounts it — no config editing). Pick either:

   **Option 1: GitHub Release tarball**

   ```bash
   dsh plugin --profile web add https://github.com/Fishquito7/dsh-skill-mcp-panel/releases/download/v2.1.0/dsh-skill-mcp-panel-2.1.0.tgz
   ```

   **Option 2: npm (prebuilt, same channel as the plugin marketplace)**

   ```bash
   dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-skill-mcp-panel
   ```

   > Both install prebuilt artifacts — no git access and no local build needed. Installing from git also works
   > (git-hosted dependencies are blocked from running their prepare build scripts by default; if you see
   > "git-hosted plugins build on install...", add the key pnpm printed under `allowBuilds` in the profile `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and re-run):
   >
   > ```bash
   > dsh plugin --profile web add github:Fishquito7/dsh-skill-mcp-panel
   > ```

2. Restart the gateway

   ```bash
   dsh-restart
   ```

   Then refresh the page: in the home sidebar, Skills sits right below Plugins and MCP right below Skills.
   Clicking one switches the main area to that panel (a global panel, not a settings dialog).

## CLI

The package ships the unified `dsh-panel` command. Skill management:

```bash
dsh-panel skill --help
```

MCP management:

```bash
dsh-panel skill list                                  # list skills (with scope: global / workspace)
dsh-panel skill add <path>                            # add to global (.md file, bundle dir, or .zip archive)
dsh-panel skill add <path> --workspace D:\projA       # add directly into a workspace
dsh-panel skill scope <name> --global                  # migrate one skill to global
dsh-panel skill scope <name> --workspace D:\projA      # migrate one skill into a workspace (--copy to copy)
dsh-panel skill migrate <name...|--all> --from <global|path> --to <global|path> [--copy] [--yes]
dsh-panel skill update [--profile <name>]  # check for updates and install (default profile: web)
                                                 # batch migrate (copy or move)
dsh-panel skill disable <name>       # disable
dsh-panel skill enable <name>        # enable
dsh-panel skill delete <name>        # delete (asks for confirmation)
```

The CLI only scans the cwd-anchored project roots and the user roots; add `--cwd <workspace-path>` to manage a different workspace's skills. If a skill name exists in several scopes, `enable`/`disable`/`delete` require `--global`/`--project`/`--workspace` to pick which copy to operate on.

## How it works

```bash
dsh-panel mcp list [--profile <name>]
dsh-panel mcp add --name <serverName> --stdio --command <cmd> [--args <arg> ...] [--env KEY=VALUE ...] [--cwd <path>] [--profile <name>]
dsh-panel mcp add --name <serverName> --http --url <url> [--header KEY=VALUE ...] [--profile <name>]
dsh-panel mcp enable|disable <serverName> [--profile <name>]
dsh-panel mcp remove <serverName> [--yes] [--profile <name>]
dsh-panel mcp test <serverName> [--profile <name>]
dsh-panel mcp update [--yes] [--profile <name>]
dsh-panel update [--yes] [--profile <name>]      # update the whole package
```

MCP configuration is written to the managed block in the target profile's `cordis.patch.yml`
(markers `# >>> dsh-skill-mcp-panel:mcp:begin` / `# <<< ...end`). Do not edit inside the block.

The plugin doesn't parse skills itself — it's just a management surface over the skill files: every action in the page (or via `dsh-panel skill`) ends up as a change to the skill files on disk (`SKILL.md`), and DSH's own file watcher notices immediately. That's why enable/disable, add, delete and migration are all hot — no gateway restart.

- A skill's entity lives directly in its scope folder: global = `~/.dsh/skills`, workspace = `<workspace>/.dsh/skills` — no hidden store, no junctions: after uninstalling the plugin the skills are plain files DSH keeps discovering
- Disable = rename `SKILL.md` to `SKILL.md.disabled`, enable = rename it back
- Changing where a skill lives = physically copying/moving the files into the target workspace folder (validated first, rolled back on failure)
- Deployment-bundled skills are read-only: they cannot be disabled or deleted

## Development

The source is TypeScript under `src/`; the compiled `lib/*.js` is committed with the repo (so git installs keep working). After editing, run `pnpm build`: `tsc` compiles to `lib/` and strips the extra module marker from the browser bundle. `npm pack` rebuilds automatically via prepack — no manual compile step.

## Uninstall

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-skill-mcp-panel
```
